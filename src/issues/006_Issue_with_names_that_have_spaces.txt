Title:Names with spaces do not go through to screens properly
Member: Jorge Aguiniga
Description: 
	Names with spaces fail to be
	recognized as being in the 
	database. Even if a new 
	spreadsheet is created, the
	view does not show up.

Discusion:
	Jorge: Luis was too lazy to add a return statement, 
	so i added the return statement becuase luis wanted to 
	create an issue for a line that could have been changed
	with adding 5 characters.
	
	Luis: Resolved
